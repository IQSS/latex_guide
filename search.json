    "text": "There are a lot of \\(\\LaTeX\\) editors that exist. Depending on what editing power, user experience, and learning cost you want out of your editor, we have three recommendations that you may wish to choose. However, these are not exhaustive, and there may be additional editors that you’d like to use.\nIf you prefer an editor with a lower startup investment and are okay with the editor having less editing power, you may wish to choose Overleaf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros\nCons\n\n\n\n\n- Collaborative  - Online, no installation  - Very modern and intuitive design\n- Reliant on UI, cannot do as much with keybindings  - Live editing can cause others to not be able to compile a file  - Not customizable\n\n\n\n\nIf you prefer an editor with a medium startup investment and medium power, you may wish to use VSCode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros\nCons\n\n\n\n\n- All-in-one-stop: has extensions for all types of coding (R, Python, etc.)  - Copilot integraton is nice for suggestions, chatbot, and ease-of-use  - Modern design, familiar IDE experience  - Somewhat customizable via exentions, settings, and keybindings\n- More control with keybindings, but limited to the packages and extensions that exist  - Installation is required, but a relatively easy process\n\n\n\n\nIf you are okay with a high startup investment in return for higher power, you may wish to use Emacs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros\nCons\n\n\n\n\n- You can do almost anything with keybindings  - Designed to do exactly what you want  - Very customizable  - Open source\n- Older, not modern design  - Need to code customizations in Lisp, which is barely used  - Need to learn a lot of keybindings to use effectively  - Installation is required\n\n\n\n\nIn sum, you may want to start with Emacs, because you may have the time and energy to learn how to use it, and you know that it can have a greater return on investment. Or, you may be okay with using Overleaf, because you don’t want to learn a bunch of keyboard shortcuts. Or, you might want an all-in-one solution where you can write all of your code with VSCode. And, of course, you might already have an IDE you like to use (TeXShop, Vim, TeXStudio, etc.). These are all fine options, too!",

Copilot is a paid service produced by GitHub that can reduce your time-on-task for coding and writing.\nCopilot easily integrates with multiple coding IDEs, including VSCode and RStudio. Copilot can recognize the coding language that you are using, predict code that you may want, and can even help you write your articles.\nOf course, you can also continue to use free or open-source generative AI programs, too, but most of those are external (i.e., require you to use a web browser) and you would have to copy and paste suggestions from your browser to your IDE. Built-in Copilot features make this process streamlined and efficient.",

Of course, you can draft your writing in programs like Google Docs (which you may prefer), but your polished versions should be .pdf files created from a .tex file.\nWhy? Common text editors like Google Docs do not yet incorporate math notation in a nice way yet. (Yes, it is feature. No, it is not good). As a budding social scientist, your work will likely need math notation in some form or another. This is exactly why \\(\\LaTeX\\) is useful. It provides a simple, replicable way to incorporate math notation into your documents.\nPlus, \\(\\LaTeX\\) has many functions that make the writing process easier. While not exhaustive, these include general formatting functions (e.g., centering, italics, etc.), bibliographic features (e.g., references and citations), and organizational abilities (e.g., connecting multiple documents together).",
